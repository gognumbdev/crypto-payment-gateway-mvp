# Set up

First, install dependencies on client:
run package manager install commands in the following path

-   challenge-khemmapich/client/
-   challenge-khemmapich/server/

These are package manager install commands

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

# Getting Started Hashpays MVP

First, start React application on client path:

-   challenge-khemmapich/client/

with the commands

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

Next, start localhost Server on server path:

-   challenge-khemmapich/server/

with the commands

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn run dev
```

Finally, Run test on server folder:
I implement unit test only server and I don't implement all functions due to I have no time. Sorry for this.
I select backend to implement test instead of frontend because in real use case frontend depend on our customer website but backend will develop by Hashpays so it is more important to care about.

-   challenge-khemmapich/server/

run on this path with the commands

```bash
npm test
# or
yarn test
```
